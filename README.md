# NewsApp

TheNews application that I have made at the end of the IOS development bootcamp organized in collaboration with UpSchool & Akbank.

- In this application, users can list and search the news after signing up and logging in. 
- They can access the details of the news.
- They can access the news by category.
- They can use dark mode option.

Technologies I Use:

⭐️ MVMM Architecture
⭐️ Firebase
⭐️ URLSession
⭐️ Combine Framework
⭐️ UserDefaults
⭐️ SDWebImage
